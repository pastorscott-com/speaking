<p>It&#8217;s been awhile since I&#8217;ve heard this song on the radio but for some reason it&#8217;s come to mind a couple of times lately.  It comes from David Baroni&#8217;s &#8220;Promised Land&#8221; project and it&#8217;s called &#8220;Took me out of Egypt.&#8221;  The message of the song is powerful.  The singer thanks God for freedom from the old way of life &#8211; &#8220;Egypt&#8221; yet finds another level of slavery, this on the inside. I love the words of this song and these are, I think at the heart of the matter:</p>
<p><em>Lord You took me out of Egypt<br />
Now take Egypt out of me<br />
You delivered me from Pharaoh now set me free from me<br />
Let my heart become a promised land<br />
Where the desert used to be<br />
Lord You took me out of Egypt<br />
Now take Egypt out of me</em></p>
<p>Thank God for his deliverance from the old way of life, it&#8217;s a transformation that makes all things new.  However, in that delivered life, over time, the believer is dismayed to find that something of the old way remains.  There&#8217;s competition for the Lordship of one&#8217;s life.  Will it be God&#8217;s way or mine?  This song describes the believer coming to a decision.  Self must bow to the Lordship of Christ.  The prayer then, is &#8220;Lord, you took me out of the old life but something of that old life remains in me.  Now, I ask that you will do a deeper work in my heart that I might be not only free from the consequences of my sin, but from the nature of sin and self.  Take the throne of my heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>I love the message of this song and even more, I love what the Lord does in the lives of those who come to that place of full surrender.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a short sample of the song, &#8220;<a href="http://www.worshipmusic.com/lib/worshipmusic/db-cd-pl-01.mp3">Took me out of Egypt</a>.&#8221;</p><p>The post <a href="/index.php/great-holiness-song/">Great holiness song</a> first appeared on <a href="">Pastor Scott's Ministerially Speaking</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sermon mode: ON<br />
I have been preaching a series of messages on the &#8220;Deeper Life.&#8221; It is a careful approach to our cardinal doctrine of entire sanctification.</p>
<p>The thing that comes to mind is how powerfully this message resonates in the lives of people. There is such a hungering for God &#8212; a longing for a deeper relationship with him.</p>
<p>Also, I have had such a strong sense of being &#8220;carried along&#8221; by the Holy Spirit as I preach along these lines. Numerous people have remarked on this anointing. I think the Lord is pleased with this theme.</p>
<p>Over the years I have envisioned the Nazarenes in town being known as such positive things as being the &#8220;praying church&#8221; or the &#8220;loving church&#8221; or the &#8220;caring church.&#8221; I certainly want all these things &#8212; but once again I have been reminded that, before all else, we are a holiness church. Without this distinctive we find ourselves just blending into the religious background.</p>
<p>All my life I have heard it said that the Church of the Nazarene was raised up to preach second blessing holiness. Today, at 33 years of ministry and counting, I am more convinced of that than ever.</p>
<p>We need to preach it carefully, correctly, and faithfully!<br />
Sermon mode: OFF</p>
