<p>It seems to me that church people don&#8217;t sing like they used to.</p>
<p>First, a few caveats:</p>
<ol>
<li>I really don&#8217;t know about churches aside from the ones we visit and when we visit we generally visit Nazarenes and their kin.</li>
<li>Of course, I don&#8217;t know about YOUR church &#8211; maybe people there sing to the top of their lungs.</li>
<li>And, of course, I&#8217;m not talking about YOU.  You may be on the Praise Team with a microphone and singing loud and strong throughout the worship service.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, with all that out of the way, let me tell you what I&#8217;m seeing.  We are pretty much <a href="http://pastorscott.com/travel/church-hopping-observations/">professional church visitors</a> through most of the year.  The worship service in the vast majority of the churches we visit looks and sounds pretty much the same:</p>
<ol>
<li>There&#8217;s a Praise Band: guitar, keyboard, bass, drums &#8211; maybe other keyboard instruments (in interest of full disclosure, I play bass guitar whenever I am asked)</li>
<li>There are singers with microphones who sing with energy</li>
<li>The words are on the screen</li>
<li>Everyone is standing anytime there is music being played</li>
</ol>
<p>So far so good.  We have music being played &#8211; generally well played.  We have leaders who are singing out.  We have the words and, most often, a repeatable melody.</p>
<p>But very few people are singing.  Usually, the church leaders are really into it: hands and faces raised in worship.  Scattered around the congregation are others who are singing along.  However, they are the minority.  My most generous estimate is that 1 in 10 worshipers are singing.  Everyone else is just standing there.</p>
<p>Maybe that&#8217;s not all bad.  Maybe they are carefully listening to the words, reading them on the screen and being deeply moved by it all.  I don&#8217;t know their hearts and I understand that it&#8217;s really none of my business.  My business is to be in the moment, turning my thoughts and spirit away from the mundane things of life and focusing on the Lord.</p>
<p>However, my hip starts aching after a while and it starts feeling to me like we&#8217;re saying the same words over and over again.  I can&#8217;t help but wonder how much longer we&#8217;re going linger at this particular stage of worship.</p>
<p>So, I start looking around, being impressed by the sincerity of the folks who are, apparently, really into the worship service.  But I also note that a lot of folks are just standing there like me.</p>
<p>I know I&#8217;m one of the senior citizens now and the old people always complain that things used to be better &#8211; longing for the good old days.  I don&#8217;t want to be one of those people.   I think the point could be made that people just don&#8217;t sing any more.  Rather, they go to concerts, stand and listen while people on stage do the singing.  I&#8217;m convinced that the concert goers aren&#8217;t there for a show, and they really do worship.  Maybe when those concert goers go to church they treat the worship service as another Christian music concert.  They are there to worship but not to sing.</p>
<p>Still, I keep going back to a worship service we attended  in a large church a couple of years ago.  We were near the front, center and, yes, we were standing for the whole song service.  There was a Praise Band and singers with microphones and words on the screens.  There was also a pipe organ and grand piano.  And we were singing a 250 year old Wesley hymn.</p>
<p>The congregation was singing their hearts out.  At first I joined in, singing bass as best I could.  Then I became overwhelmed and had to stop singing.  I just stood there letting the sound of all the voices wash over me.</p>
<p>I miss being part of a congregation that sings like that.</p>
<p>And, by the way, my hip didn&#8217;t hurt at all that day.</p><p>The post <a href="/index.php/have-church-people-stopped-singing/">Have church people stopped singing?</a> first appeared on <a href="">Pastor Scott's Ministerially Speaking</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In the old days, every pastor on the district was required to give a verbal report to the Assembly. Some of the reports were inspiring and some not so much. At some point through the years Mom started &#8220;grading&#8221; pastors. If she liked the way the pastor reported she would put a mark beside their name. She explained that if it so happened that during the year our church went through a pastoral transition (and it happened a lot during those days &#8211; the average pastoral tenure at that time was less than three years) she would use her star system to vet potential candidates.</p>
<p>Honestly, I don&#8217;t know that it ever happened that way, but she was ready &#8211; just in case.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/facebook-mobile-app-820x4201.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-2761 size-thumbnail" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/facebook-mobile-app-820x4201-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>As I remember her approach I realize that we do something similar with Facebook these days. In the past few years I&#8217;ve been involved in a couple of churches going through a change of pastors. Both times, as soon a potential candidate&#8217;s name became known a significant number of people headed for Facebook to find out all they could about the candidate.</p>
<p>And, using Facebook in particular and Google in general, you can find out a lot about a person. Some things are really easy to see and others take a bit of digging, but if a person is even marginally Facebook savvy they can learn a lot about someone who posts on Facebook.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not discounting the spiritual in the least here. For years I&#8217;ve encouraged church people to see a pastoral search as a spiritual rather than business endeavour. Still, I think church people are probably wise to use this to their advantage, at least in the early part of the process. We all know that resumes don&#8217;t tell the whole story. If a pastor is active on Facebook it is easy to get a more candid look at how they interact with people and what interests them when they are &#8220;off the clock.&#8221; This, I think, can help churches find a good match when they are looking for a new pastor.</p><p>The post <a href="/index.php/looking-for-a-pastor/">Looking for a pastor</a> first appeared on <a href="">Pastor Scott's Ministerially Speaking</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Wow, retirement anniversary number two.  It was the first Sunday of May, 2013 that we concluded our pastoral ministry and entered into retirement.  In our case, we retired to travel and the very next day we drove off with our RV, starting the next primary chapter of our lives.</p>
<p>This last year has been terrific.  <a href="http://pastorscott.com/travel/2014-adventure-wrap-up/">We traveled from Houston to the northwestern corner </a>of the continental United States and then journeyed at a leisurely pace south along the western coast where we enjoyed amazing scenery and cool Pacific Ocean temperatures.  We visited numerous national parks and, in general, had a blast.</p>
<p>Our winter and early spring has been spent doing a variation of our fulltime RVing lifestyle.  We’ve <a href="http://pastorscott.com/travel/update-wrap-up-on-volunteering-at-san-jacinto-monumentbattleship-texas/">volunteered at the Texas San Jacinto Battleground/Battleship Texas State Historic Park</a>.  In exchange for donating 100 hours of our time each month we’ve enjoyed “free parking.”  That “trade” has saved us some serious, and needed, cash! We’ve thoroughly enjoyed this experience which allowed us to do some very interesting things while being close to family and friends.  While we’re more than ready to begin our travels again we enjoyed the volunteering experience enough that we’ve already signed up to do it again next year.</p>
<p>I did a few more clergy-like things than I did our first year but not a lot.  I filled for our pastor when he was away, filled in for our Sunday School teacher (who happens to be my son) when he was away, did a baby dedication, and finalized <a href="http://pastorscott.com/index.php/books-by-pastor-scott/">my series of books of devotionals</a>.  Aside from that I’ve happily sat in the pew, appreciating the ministry of others.</p>
<p>All in all, we’ve spent over 4 months in the Houston area during this stay.  That means we suspended our “<a href="http://pastorscott.com/travel/church-hopping-observations/">church hopping</a>” ways and settled into a more typical church attendance routine.  While visiting many different churches during our travels is enjoyable we’ve missed the sense of community associated with being a part of a congregation.  This being our second winter as part of our home church helped us feel more a part of things.  It’s interesting to me how things we at first felt were somehow different become, in just a few weeks, just “the way it is done here.”  One thing that become increasingly clear is that no church can be evaluated in just a week or two.  Churches have personalities and that personality isn’t apparent until one is part of the congregation (and involved beyond an hour on Sunday mornings) for a while.  Don’t get me wrong: I enjoy visiting churches, but I know that being a regular, contributing part of a church <span style="color: #444444;">family is superior.</span></p>
<p>So, I’d say retirement is going quite well, thank you!  We’re well aware that we are blessed to live this life and we don’t take it for granted.</p><p>The post <a href="/index.php/reflections-on-the-second-anniversary-of-my-retirement/">Reflections on the second anniversary of my retirement</a> first appeared on <a href="">Pastor Scott's Ministerially Speaking</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hRbSeP0QLQQ/TxxXBZ3_jWI/AAAAAAAATo8/NB7ECQfbCbo/s1600/zachaeous.jpg" alt="" width="379" height="367" />No, I&#8217;m not going to complain about the style of music or being asked to stand through the <del>song</del> -er- worship service. Here are three contemporary worship services practices that I am seeing that bug me.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Volume of instruments in the praise band.</strong> This may surprise you, but I&#8217;m not talking about the music being too loud. We seldom come away from a service in a church of our flavor (Church of the Nazarene) thinking the music is too loud. What I do hear fairly often, though, is unbalanced volume from the various instruments in the band. Often, even when the stage has several instruments, the only two I can hear clearly are the strumming of the worship leader on the guitar and the drummer. If you closed your eyes you would think that was all there was: no keyboard, no bass, no second guitar. Of course there are variations to that. Sometimes the music guy plays keyboard and it&#8217;s the keyboard you hear. Really, if you are going to recruit instrumentalists to your praise band and have them come to rehearsal it&#8217;s reasonable that your music and sound people work together to balance the sound. Obviously, there are exemptions &#8211; maybe you have a not-so-talented musician that you want to encourage by having them sit in. Aside from that, though, an effort needs to be made to equalize the sound.</li>
<li><strong>Self-serve communion.</strong> It is becoming more common to put the communion elements out and announce to the congregation that during the next song they can come and receive communion if they want. I can&#8217;t tell you what poor symbolism I think this is. Communion isn&#8217;t a self-serve event. It isn&#8217;t an &#8220;if you want it&#8221; kind of ordinance. Just continuing with the music portion of the service as though communion is just a side line misses the mark. I love communion and I think it has enough spiritual &#8220;weight&#8221; to hold it&#8217;s own in a service. I don&#8217;t mind the ritual being updated in some reasonable ways, but I want the pastor to lend his/her authority to the serving of the sacrament.  It bugs me to hear the pastor taking time to do announcements as though that is really important stuff but leaving the serving of the Lord&#8217;s Supper on automatic as though it&#8217;s just an optional part of that Sunday&#8217;s worship service.</li>
<li><strong>Preaching from floor level rather than the platform.</strong> I understand the desire of pastors to be informal and approachable during the sermon. I understand that in a contemporary worship service the speaker doesn&#8217;t want to appear preachy. Apparently, a lot of pastors have decided that, not only do they not want a pulpit, but they want to be down front rather than on the stage looking down on people. But let me tell you what happens out in the seats: some of us spend the whole sermon trying to look around the people in front of us. After awhile I gain a whole new appreciation for Zacchaeus of New Testament fame who climbed a tree so he could get a glimpse of Jesus. If the speaker would just stand on the platform we could all see him or her. Some pastors think they are enhancing their communication effort by staying off the platform, but I think they are shooting themselves in the foot by creating an absolutely unnecessary distraction.</li>
</ol>
<p>Any time I see young adults in the church who are really into worship it blesses my heart and I&#8217;m happily convinced that a lot of contemporary churches are doing a lot of things right.  Still, I have to confess that these things bug me.</p>

<p>While I don’t think there is a right or wrong approach in how most churches observe the sacrament I do think that the freedom to vary the emphasis and approach and even mechanics of observing it can be an advantage for less liturgical churches.   Whether or not you agree with me here, I hope you’ll find some of these thoughts helpful.</p>
<p><b>Communion is more of a celebration than anything else.</b>  We don’t believe Jesus dies again each time we receive communion and it isn’t only about shed blood and broken body.   Mainly, we’re celebrating the amazing love the Lord has for us.   Jesus willingly went to the cross because “God so loved the world.”  There, on that old rugged cross, he conquered sin and death.  His victory has become mine.  We don’t celebrate the brokenness and bleeding but we do celebrate the reason for it and what it has accomplished in and for us. <i> “We come today to celebrate the greatest act of love, the most beneficial sacrifice ever accomplished….”</i></p>
<p><b>Communion is the perfect platform for inviting people to come to Jesus. </b> As a young person I somehow had the idea that the Lord’s Supper could be hazardous to one’s health.  We were to examine ourselves and if we had experienced any spiritual failure we might be wise to skip communion that quarter.  Over time I began to understand that, while it was possible to receive communion in an unworthy manner (that is, without showing proper reverence) that, honestly, no one is worthy of receiving these emblems of the Lord’s body and blood.  Had we been worthy, he would have never had to go to the cross in the first place.  With that in mind, I began to see the sacrament as an invitation to Christ.  As I examine my heart and realize that there are spiritual failures I’m not disqualified from the bread and wine.  Rather, I’m being given an opportunity to avail myself of the mercy and grace of the Lord in a fresh way.  If I come, viewing my receiving communion as a substitute for repentance and faith I’m moving into the “unworthy” territory.  If I come seeking forgiveness and restoration, though, I find life in that sacrament.  <i>“The Bible says we’re to examine ourselves before receiving communion.  So let’s do that.  If, as you consider your relationship with the Lord and find that things aren’t what they ought to be, that doesn’t mean you can’t receive communion today.  Instead, this is an opportunity to make things right with the Lord.  As you receive the bread and wine, receive Jesus into your life all over again.”</i></p>
<p><b>Communion is a great way to introduce your child to Jesus.</b>  Honestly, I think our liturgical friends with their emphasis on “first communion” have a great approach.  However, that doesn’t mean that there aren’t advantages to a less structured, low church approach.  As a pastor I allowed parents to bring their children forward to receive communion provided the parent agreed to have a discussion with that child about allowing Jesus to be their Lord and Savior before the day was over.  Symbols are powerful and children can grasp spiritual realities earlier than we might think.  I let parents decide if their children are “there” yet.  <i>“Parents, I’ll let you decide when your children are ready to receive communion.  If you do allow your child to come today, I ask this of you: let’s agree that before this day is over you will sit down with your child and talk about the meaning of communion and how it is that a person places their faith in Jesus.”</i></p>
<p><b>Communion ought to be the focus of at least one service a year.</b>  Baptism has been called the “entry sacrament” to our life in Christ.  Communion is the “continuing sacrament.”  One Sunday a year the church service should be all about the Lord’s Supper (World Communion Sunday is the first Sunday of October).   Sing songs about it, read the appropriate scriptures, and preach a sermon that reminds us why we celebrate communion.  Talk about our unity with believers across the ages and in the various traditions of Christianity.  Talk about God’s love for us and Christ’s willingness to die for us.  Remind people of its connection to the Marriage Supper of the Lamb.  Tell them why the Lord’s Supper is called a “means of grace.”  Then, invite people to the table of the Lord.  Pastor, on this Sunday, you do all the serving, taking the role of Jesus, himself.  <i>“Today is World Communion Sunday and we’re going to join Christians of many traditions around the world in receiving communion.  Before we do that though, let’s think about the meaning and purpose of this sacrament of the Church.”</i></p><p>The post <a href="/index.php/communion/">Communion</a> first appeared on <a href="">Pastor Scott's Ministerially Speaking</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>These days Jackie and I are enjoying visiting lots of different churches.  Every week or two we are in a different place and ready to join some congregation in worship.  Being Nazarenes our first choice is one of our own tribe although I am quick to add that we&#8217;ve enjoyed fellowship in a variety of groups.</p>
<p>Sometimes we&#8217;ve driven past a church nearby and have stopped to check out any church sign for information, but most of the time we head for the internet.  The results are a real mixed bag.  I&#8217;ve seen church websites that looked terrific and I&#8217;ve hunted for church information only to come up empty.  I&#8217;ve found lots of good, current information and I&#8217;ve found some nice looking websites that are horribly out of date.</p>
<p>So here are a few words of advice concerning your church web site:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you don&#8217;t have a web site get one!  Listen, whether or not you are interested in the Internet, most people are.  Not having a website today is equal to not being in the phone book 10 years ago.  You NEED a website.</li>
<li>If you post current events keep them current.  Listing last year&#8217;s Christmas party as current says bad things about your church.  Compare it to not having the grass mowed at the church &#8211; it speaks of not caring, not being organized, and of neglect.</li>
<li>If you aren&#8217;t going to keep the site current then DON&#8217;T post any current events.  Turn the website into a billboard for the church with only static information including some of the things I&#8217;m about to list.</li>
<li>Post your service times and make them easy to find.</li>
<li>Post your church address and include directions.  It&#8217;s amazing how many church websites never bother to name their state.  Put complete directions, and make them easy to find.</li>
<li>If you want to do more, a really nice thing to do is include some photos, especially of the church in worship.  My wife often wonders what the ladies wear to church.  She knows that we will be welcome even if we don&#8217;t quite meet the local dress code, but she wants to fit in.  Photos of people in a regular worship service help a lot.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember, people DO look you up on the Internet.  Don&#8217;t just have a Facebook page &#8211; not everyone can see it.  DON&#8217;T let someone&#8217;s nephew who is a whizbang at doing fancy webpages do yours.  It needs to look on purpose and grown up.  Simple with relevant information is better than impressive and out of date because no one who actually cares about the church&#8217;s image has a clue as to how to update the page and the nephew is long gone.  You can have a reasonable, easy to maintain, easy to Google website for very little money.  Really, trust me, you NEED a website that meets at least certain minimum standards.</p>

<p>Sermon mode: ON<br />
I have been preaching a series of messages on the &#8220;Deeper Life.&#8221; It is a careful approach to our cardinal doctrine of entire sanctification.</p>
<p>The thing that comes to mind is how powerfully this message resonates in the lives of people. There is such a hungering for God &#8212; a longing for a deeper relationship with him.</p>
<p>Also, I have had such a strong sense of being &#8220;carried along&#8221; by the Holy Spirit as I preach along these lines. Numerous people have remarked on this anointing. I think the Lord is pleased with this theme.</p>
<p>Over the years I have envisioned the Nazarenes in town being known as such positive things as being the &#8220;praying church&#8221; or the &#8220;loving church&#8221; or the &#8220;caring church.&#8221; I certainly want all these things &#8212; but once again I have been reminded that, before all else, we are a holiness church. Without this distinctive we find ourselves just blending into the religious background.</p>
<p>All my life I have heard it said that the Church of the Nazarene was raised up to preach second blessing holiness. Today, at 33 years of ministry and counting, I am more convinced of that than ever.</p>
<p>We need to preach it carefully, correctly, and faithfully!<br />
Sermon mode: OFF</p>
