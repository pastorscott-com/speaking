This day speaks to people facing great disappointment, people who are hurt and confused, and people who cry out to God but have received no answer.</p>
<p>Since we have the advantage of knowing what tomorrow is all about we tend to see Holy Saturday as merely a day of preparation for the big celebration, but the day actually has its own message.</p>
<p>This day speaks to people who are hurt and confused; to those who are living in a spiritual desert where the voice of God has not been heard. Holy Saturday teaches us to be stubborn in our faith; insisting on standing firm in it even when it feels as if all is lost.</p>

<p>Instead, for six hours, from 9 to 3, gaze at the cross and the One suffering on it. Realize that he is hanging there for all of us, unworthy though we are. Realize he is hanging there for just one reason: love.</p>
<p>Save all the rest till later. For now, spend time at the foot of the cross.</p>
