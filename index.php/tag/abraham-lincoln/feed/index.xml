										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I love this letter from Abraham Lincoln:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>One day . . . I got into a fit of musing in my room and stood resting my elbows on the bureau. Looking into the glass, it struck me what an ugly man I was. The fact grew on me and I made up my mind that I must be the ugliest man in the world. It so maddened me that I resolved, should I ever see an uglier, I would shoot him on sight. Not long after this, Andy [naming a lawyer present] came to town and the first time I saw him I said to myself: &#8216;There&#8217;s the man.&#8217; I went home, took down my gun, and prowled around the streets waiting for him. He soon came along. &#8216;Halt, Andy,&#8217; said I, pointing the gun at him, &#8216;say your prayers, for I am going to shoot you.&#8217; &#8216;Why, Mr. Lincoln, what&#8217;s the matter? What have I done?&#8217; &#8216;Well, I made an oath that if I ever saw an uglier man than I am, I&#8217;d shoot him on the spot. You are uglier, surely; so make ready to die.&#8217; &#8216;Mr. Lincoln, do you really think that I am uglier than you?&#8217; &#8216;Yes.&#8217; &#8216;Well, Mr. Lincoln,&#8217; said Andy deliberately and looking me squarely in the face, &#8216;if I am any uglier, fire away.&#8217; </em></p></blockquote>
