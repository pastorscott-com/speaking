										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://transformaelmundo.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/phineas-bresee.jpg" width="211" height="265" class="alignright size-large" />P.F. Bresee is considered to be the founder of the <a href="http://www.nazarene.org/">Church of the Nazarene</a>.  He was one of the people instrumental in helping the various groups who came together to form the denomination to find common ground.  They didn&#8217;t agree at every point, but they agreed to allow people to arrive at their own understanding on a broad range of doctrinal issues while holding fast to certain core beliefs.  To find out what those core beliefs are, check out the &#8220;Agreed Statement of Belief&#8221; section around page 37 in the <a href="http://www.nazarene.org/files/docs/Manual2009-2013.pdf">Manual of the Church of the Nazarene</a>.</p>
<p>Concerning all the other stuff, Bresee urged tolerance governed by love.  Here&#8217;s one of Brezee&#8217;s statements on this topic:</p>
<blockquote><p>“On the great fundamentals we are all agreed. Pertaining to things not essential to salvation, we have liberty. <strong>To attempt to emphasize that which is not essential to salvation and thus to divide forces, would be a crime. An unwillingness for others to enjoy the liberty that we enjoy in reference to doctrines not vital to salvation is bigotry, from which the spirit of holiness withdraws itself</strong>.” (Bold by me)</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard various versions of the first part of this quote several times, but the second is new to me.  Apparently, Bresee isn&#8217;t just all warm and fuzzy on this topic.  Rather, he&#8217;s rather stern about it, saying those who insist on loading other stuff into the equation are practicing a sort of doctrinal &#8220;bigotry&#8221; and, because of that are operating somewhere outside the &#8220;spirit of holiness.&#8221;</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t help but wonder what he would think of some of the debates and finger pointing we see within our number today.</p><p>The post <a href="/index.php/quote-from-pf-bresee-concerning-nazarene-doctrine/">Quote from P.F.
