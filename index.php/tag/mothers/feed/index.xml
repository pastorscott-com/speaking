										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I know I&#8217;m risking becoming the target of mothers everywhere, but I&#8217;ve got to say it: pastors shouldn&#8217;t preach about mothers on Mother&#8217;s Day.  Take time early in the service.  Give &#8217;em flowers or bookmarks or some other nice gift.  Pray a fervent prayer, thanking God for moms and asking his blessings on them.</p>
<p>Then&#8230;get on with the service.  Don&#8217;t sing &#8220;My Mother&#8217;s Old Bible is True&#8221; and &#8220;When Mama Prayed Heaven Paid Attention.&#8221;  Preach whatever you would have preached otherwise.  Stick to the schedule&#8230;stay in your series, etc.  After all, while &#8220;honoring mother and father&#8221; are certainly Biblical concepts, Mother&#8217;s Day and Father&#8217;s Day aren&#8217;t actually Biblical holidays.  Change the schedule for Pentecost and Easter and maybe Ascension Day but stay the course for &#8220;Hallmark holidays.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Moms, we love you and appreciate you, but we hope you&#8217;re okay with us not building the entire service around you.  </p>
