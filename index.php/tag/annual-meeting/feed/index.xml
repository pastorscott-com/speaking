<p>In my Zion, the Church of the Nazarene, there&#8217;s a required annual church meeting in which the business of the church is conducted. I&#8217;m writing with my own denomination in mind but I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if this approach is applicable for other groups as well.</p>
<p>There are several reports to be heard in this meeting: youth, missions, stewards, trustees, treasurer, secretary, and others. The old way to do it was to set aside a Sunday night for reports and voting. Frankly, it wasn&#8217;t an inspiring event and a lot of folks opted to do something else that night.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really too bad. Some of our finest people serve faithfully through the year and the church really does need to hear them tell what they&#8217;ve done. Hearing them report reminds the congregation of the many things that happen in the church that don&#8217;t take place on the platform on Sunday mornings.</p>
<p>So, here&#8217;s the solution. During the weeks leading up to the voting, take time each Sunday morning to hear three or so reports. Ask those reporting to take three or four minutes for their reports. Following each report, have everyone clap and cheer.</p>
<p>This approach will allow the congregation to focus on each report and not get saturated from hearing one report after another. It also puts the church leaders up front on a Sunday morning &#8212; giving honor to those to whom honor is due.</p>
<p>Pastors, of all people, understand the importance of highlighting the efforts of dedicated laypeople in the church and this is an excellent way to do it.</p><p>The post <a href="/index.php/advice-to-young-pastors-annual-meetings-1/">Advice to young pastors: Annual Meetings #1</a> first appeared on <a href="">Pastor Scott's Ministerially Speaking</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>
