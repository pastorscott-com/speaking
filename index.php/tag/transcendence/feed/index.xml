										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my studies, I learned that the holiness of God has three aspects:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Purity:</span> God is absolutely free from sin</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">&#8220;Otherness&#8221;:</span> He is beyond us in every way &#8211; there is that about Him that we can never comprehend, and the only things we can know about Him are those things He reveals to us</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Transcendence:</span> He is glorious, bright and beautiful</li>
</ol>
<p>I have been considering what that means in relation to the holiness available to human beings.  I think that the three aspects of God&#8217;s holiness are mirrored in the lives of those who have fully yielded their lives to Him:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Purity:</span> God is willing and able to purify the hearts of those who surrender their all to Him</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">&#8220;Otherness&#8221;:</span> God calls us, as a holy people to be separate from the world &#8211; to be &#8220;in it but not of it&#8221;</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Transcendent:</span> that is, we are to reflect the glory of God &#8211; to be the &#8220;light of the world&#8221;</li>
</ol>
<p>Please note that when we speak of holiness like this we must remember that God <strong>is</strong> holy and we, by his grace, are <strong>being made</strong> holy.  Holiness in men and women is only possible by God&#8217;s creating a reflection of His holiness in us.</p>
