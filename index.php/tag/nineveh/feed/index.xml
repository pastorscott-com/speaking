										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of our challenges as God&#8217;s people is to know what we believe and why, yet at the same time, allow God to work in ways that, to us, color outside the lines. We aren&#8217;t saved by believing all the right things &#8212; we&#8217;re saved by grace. In the OT story of Jonah he knows for sure that the people of Nineveh are bad people, enemies of God&#8217;s people. He doesn&#8217;t want to go and warn them of judgment to come because he fears they will repent and escape that judgment. He knows God isn&#8217;t like him &#8211; that God is compassionate and forgiving&#8230;and all Jonah wants is to see Nineveh destroyed.</p>
<p>We can arrive at an understanding of the basics of Christianity and pretty much agree that some things are outside of our faith. We can condemn some beliefs as out and out heretical &#8211; and do so for all the right reasons. One result is that we believe we are mandated to take the real gospel to those in that &#8220;Nineveh.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the same time &#8211; and here&#8217;s the challenge &#8211; we have to remember that believing all the right things is, for some reason, more important to us than it is to God. By his grace he colors outside the lines, accepting people who are on a journey and a long way from arriving at the &#8220;right&#8221; destination.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad for God&#8217;s grace to me. Sometimes, I&#8217;m a bit uncomfortable with his grace to you.</p>
