										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Keith Drury has a thought provoking article: <a href="http://www.drurywriting.com/keith/mediocrity.htm">In search of Mediocrity</a> &#8212; he reminds us that most of us live somewhere in the middle and specifically talks about Churches, Marriage, and Spiritual Passion.  Here&#8217;s his take on churches in middle:<br />
<span style="font-style: italic"><br />
&#8220;I think ordinary churches deserve more praise. I’m talking about churches in the big fat center who don’t have thousands of attendees and sprawling TV ministries. They aren’t famous and nobody ever asks their pastor to teach “How I Did It” seminars. But the pastor and people show up every week and worship and study and serve each other and love their community. Good for you!  I wish more of my students wanted to go to ordinary churches.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a short and good read.  Check it out.</p>
