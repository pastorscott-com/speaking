										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="http://localhost/speaking/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/parking.jpg"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2545" src="http://localhost/speaking/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/parking.jpg" alt="parking" width="225" height="225" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/parking.jpg 225w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/04/parking-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a></em>The story of the Crucifixion is powerful. The cross was more an instrument of torture than it was one of execution. Some film makers have made it their mission to portray the agony of the cross with as much graphic realism possible.  Maybe it&#8217;s that realism or something else but it seems to me that many Christians are stalled at the cross, thinking it is what Easter is all about.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not. Easter is about victory, hope, and redemption. The only reason to go to Good Friday is because we can&#8217;t get to Easter without it. However, the enduring symbol of Christianity isn&#8217;t (or at least shouldn&#8217;t be) a crucifix. Rather, it&#8217;s an empty cross. The reason we don&#8217;t make a cross with its victim our primary symbol isn&#8217;t because we can&#8217;t bear seeing Jesus hanging on it. We make an empty cross our primary symbol because Jesus is no longer on the cross. He has defeated it and all it stood for.</p>
<p>So, for believers, Good Friday is a &#8220;No Parking Zone.&#8221; We spend time on Good Friday remembering the cross and especially the love of Jesus for us that caused him to endure it. But we happily turn the page to Sunday morning, Resurrection Day.</p>
<p>Easter services shouldn&#8217;t be about the Crucifixion. References to the cross should be about Christ&#8217;s victory over it. If pastors and other church leaders have done their job the ordeal of the cross should have already been brought to the attention of the Church. That paves the way for Easter.  Individuals too should make it their practice to visit the cross on a regular basis, but not park there.  Its the Resurrection that transforms the crucifix into an empty cross and its the Resurrection that should be our primary focus.  Let&#8217;s turn the page from Good Friday and celebrate the Resurrection of our Lord and what it means to us.</p>

<p>Save all the rest till later. For now, spend time at the foot of the cross.</p>
