										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/girl.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3505" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/girl.png" alt="" width="168" height="227" /></a>In Matthew 19:14 Jesus says: <em>“Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.”</em> I understand that it is common for people of that society to bring their children to respected rabbis to receive a blessing. People who see Jesus as a worthy teacher want him to bless their children but for some reason the disciples don&#8217;t want them to interrupt the &#8220;important&#8221; work Jesus is doing to stop and deal with children.</p>
<p>Jesus famously welcomes the children and uses them to reenforce his teaching on how to live in the Kingdom of God.</p>
<p>One way the Church tries to follow this &#8220;let the little children come&#8221; directive of our Lord is by practicing child baptism, or baby dedication. Churches often make a serious effort to minister to children by staffing a children&#8217;s department in the church program.</p>
<p>While I appreciate the need for children&#8217;s programming in the church, I think we need to be careful to involve them in the larger life of the church. It is worth the effort to find ways to connect our boys and girls to the worship services. While I don&#8217;t think we need to turn Sunday morning worship into a big &#8220;children&#8217;s church&#8221; I do think we can make an effort to include children in our regular worship services, if not every Sunday, at least on a regular basis. Children should be familiar with what we do in church even when the service isn&#8217;t all about them (in a Christmas program, for instance).</p>
<p>Pastors should be able to craft sermons that are easy for elementary children to follow. If needed, most children&#8217;s workers can suggest handouts, crafts, visual aids to help children connect to a well-planned sermon meant to minister to both children and adults. Also, it is likely a good thing for the pastor to practice a bit of self-discipline in regard to sermon length and material.  Granted, I&#8217;m not thinking so much of an every-Sunday approach here (although some carry it off nicely) as I am of maybe a monthly &#8220;family Sunday&#8221; or something similar.</p>
<p>Really, Jesus didn&#8217;t tell the disciples to take the children off to another room and teach them a children&#8217;s lesson. Rather, he included them in what he was doing right then and there.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft " src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/notredame.jpg" width="471" height="353" />The Apostle Paul said: <em>&#8220;For when I preach the gospel, I cannot boast, since I am compelled to preach. Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel!&#8221;</em> (1 Corinthians 9:16). The anchor of our preaching must be the Good News of Jesus. It is so easy to get drawn into social commentary or political concerns or something similar. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, there&#8217;s a time and place to address current issues. However, they must always be addressed in the context of the Gospel message. &#8220;Our nation believes thus-and-so but, in Christ, the Lord offers us a better way.&#8221; It is so easy for the preacher to use pulpit time to denounce everything that is wrong while neglecting the hope that Jesus brings to the world. In the 1 Corinthians passage Paul is challenging the church&#8217;s treatment of himself. They have taken him for granted and even accused him of trying to boss them around. Paul defends himself, but also states, <em>&#8220;we put up with anything rather than hinder the gospel of Christ.&#8221;</em> For him, it is all about getting the Good News out. Pastor don&#8217;t squander your pulpit time on other stuff. When you do point out sin in society do so only to offer hope for the sinner. Our calling is clear: preach the Gospel.</p>

We visit a lot of churches so we have a fairly large sample size to draw from. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m exaggerating when I say that it is fairly common for the &#8220;call to worship&#8221; to include some kind of commentary on football! It is always done in a light touch and a smile and I understand the pastor&#8217;s desire to appear relevant to current events. Honestly, I&#8217;d rather hear that than some kind of political comment (and, yes, I&#8217;ve heard that too).</p>
<p>Listen, I like football and sports in general. I like talking about it with my friends. But when I go to church my focus is on something else &#8212; Someone else. Start the service off with something spiritual; maybe a reminder that we are gathering for a serious purpose. That&#8217;s not to say we don&#8217;t come with joy and expectation &#8211; or that we don&#8217;t enjoy fellowship with one another. Of course we do.</p>
<p>It seems to me many of us are already struggling to get our minds off of a thousand other things as we come to worship. Instead of legitimizing the trivial how about reading a powerful passage of scripture and reminding worshipers that we serve an awesome God and that we are, right now, coming into his presence?</p>
<p>I have to admit that I didn&#8217;t arrive at this opinion early in my ministry. In fact, as a young pastor I let the song leader (that&#8217;s what we called them back in the old days) get up and announce the first song. This without any input from me at all. As time passed I began to think about how we were beginning our worship services and decided that some of our high church friends were on to something with their liturgical calls to worship.</p>
<p>I started seeking out scriptures that called people into worship and began opening services with scripture and prayer. It may just be my imagination but I think the services took on a more Christ-centered atmosphere.</p>
<p>Now, all the above, I know, must be taken with a strong dose of common sense. When the home town team is playing the Super Bowl there&#8217;s room for some level of public commentary. Also, there&#8217;s a lot of good sermon illustrations in the world of sports. Still, that kind of stuff has a very limited shelf life and should be used sparingly.</p>
<p>This is, of course, all just my opinion. Still, pastor, it might be reasonable to consider how to best invite people to enter into a spirit of worship.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure style="width: 1600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OIPxWg7XI4c/XBQDvFyKd8I/AAAAAAAA3-4/e6JgfdV0Bio3wJ-Nw4tC5c1p5-C0s3JQwCKgBGAs/s1600/photo.JPG" alt="" width="1600" height="1195" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">2014 &#8211; Oysterville Historic Church &#8211; Near Long Beach, WA (not the church in the story)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I heard a pastor deliver a heartfelt message calling for his congregation to really commit to the church.  He told the church that he had had opportunities to go elsewhere, including a return to his home area to a previous pastorate.  However, he had turned it down because he was committed to this current church.  Then, at the conclusion of the message all those in attendance were invited to join the pastor in his commitment by coming forward as a testimony to their allegiance.</p>
<p>Frankly, there was nothing wrong with any of this.  However, having known many of those laypersons for over 20 years I couldn&#8217;t help but smile to myself.  If anyone was qualified to call anyone to real commitment to the local church it was several of those laypersons.  They have already proven themselves faithful.  Several, for a lifetime.  They stayed true to that church through a series of pastors who after a while had declared that the Lord was calling them elsewhere.  They hung in there through some hard times when others moved on to a church down the street.</p>
<p>These were the people who had financially supported the church through the years.  They gave of their time by teaching Sunday School, working in VBS, leading Bible Quiz programs, and showing up for church work days.  They showed up for choir rehearsals and took a turn mowing the church lawn.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, pastors had come and gone.  Some retiring and others just packing up to continue their ministry elsewhere.  Listen, I know that that happens.  I do believe that there comes a time when a person needs to move on in their ministry – often for reasons they, themselves, don&#8217;t understand.  Circumstances change and both church and pastor can benefit from a healthy change.  Also, in my own ministry, especially in my younger years, I ran out of gas way too early in more than one assignment.  Happily, and to my credit (I think) my stays got longer as I matured in my ministry.</p>
<p>I also understand that some church people need to make a decision and quit playing church.  Some folks have been around the church for years and are still hanging out in the shallows rather than fully committing to the Lord and his Church.  They need to be challenged to go deeper in their spiritual lives.</p>
<p>Still, as I watched those who are prime examples of commitment and faithfulness respond to that sermon I couldn&#8217;t help but think things were the reverse of what they should have been.  It was those people who should have been challenging the pastor to commitment.  They should have been on the platform inviting him to come forward and accept their example.</p>
<p>Or, maybe said better, the good pastor should have told his congregation that the example of many in the congregation had inspired him and, as a result, he was committing to them to join them in their faithfulness.  I really doubt that some of them could be more committed to their church than they already are, and have proven over the decades.</p>
<p>Many churches are full of dedicated people who love their church and continue to sacrifice time, talent, and treasure.  We can only hope for pastors who will join them in that commitment.</p>

In the old days, every pastor on the district was required to give a verbal report to the Assembly. Some of the reports were inspiring and some not so much. At some point through the years Mom started &#8220;grading&#8221; pastors. If she liked the way the pastor reported she would put a mark beside their name. She explained that if it so happened that during the year our church went through a pastoral transition (and it happened a lot during those days &#8211; the average pastoral tenure at that time was less than three years) she would use her star system to vet potential candidates.</p>
<p>Honestly, I don&#8217;t know that it ever happened that way, but she was ready &#8211; just in case.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/facebook-mobile-app-820x4201.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-2761 size-thumbnail" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/facebook-mobile-app-820x4201-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>As I remember her approach I realize that we do something similar with Facebook these days. In the past few years I&#8217;ve been involved in a couple of churches going through a change of pastors. Both times, as soon a potential candidate&#8217;s name became known a significant number of people headed for Facebook to find out all they could about the candidate.</p>
<p>And, using Facebook in particular and Google in general, you can find out a lot about a person. Some things are really easy to see and others take a bit of digging, but if a person is even marginally Facebook savvy they can learn a lot about someone who posts on Facebook.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not discounting the spiritual in the least here. For years I&#8217;ve encouraged church people to see a pastoral search as a spiritual rather than business endeavour. Still, I think church people are probably wise to use this to their advantage, at least in the early part of the process. We all know that resumes don&#8217;t tell the whole story. If a pastor is active on Facebook it is easy to get a more candid look at how they interact with people and what interests them when they are &#8220;off the clock.&#8221; This, I think, can help churches find a good match when they are looking for a new pastor.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coming from a low church background I had very little pastoral training for conducting baptisms.  Also, in spite of my denomination&#8217;s acceptance of infant baptism, it was never practiced in the portions of the country where I grew up or ministered &#8211; everywhere I served people wanted to get wet all over and that&#8217;s what happened.  Because of that, I&#8217;ll focus in on baptism services for youth and adults &#8211; and, for the sake of this article, I&#8217;m more thinking of in-church baptisms rather than I am those that take place at a lake or river (although most of my suggestions work either way).</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Be sure people are prepared for baptism.  Pastor, that&#8217;s your job.  Don&#8217;t leave it to the youth pastor or Sunday School teacher or a parent.  Be ready to sit down with a candidate and, in an age appropriate way, work through what it means to be a Christian and why we baptize.  Of course, that means you have to understand it.  In our tradition we baptize as a means of grace.  That means, to us, it&#8217;s more than an outward witness.  It&#8217;s a sacrament &#8211; can you explain what that means to a 12 year old?  That&#8217;s exactly what you have to do if you are going to officiate at their baptism.</li>
<li>Write your own version of the baptism ritual.  I don&#8217;t mean that you have the freedom to make it say something it doesn&#8217;t already say, but if your candidates&#8217; (and your congregations&#8217;) eyes glaze over as you read the ritual you are just saying meaningless words.  Say it in such a way that they will understand what you are saying to them.</li>
<li>Have the candidates write out (or video) their testimony and have it read by a spiritual mentor just prior to their baptism.</li>
<li>Have everyone say the Apostle&#8217;s Creed together.  Don&#8217;t read the creed to the candidates &#8211; have them and the congregation say it and affirm it together.  After all, you are, by baptizing the candidates, uniting them with the congregation at a whole new level.  By the way, you and your congregation ought to be familiar with the Creed&#8230;maybe not memorized, but used to saying it.  This is who we are and what we believe.  Work it into Communion services or just include it in a service once a month.</li>
<li>If you are using some kind of hybrid baptistery where people sit down, etc.  then practice!  Let them get into the baptistery when it is dry and see what you expect of them (and yourself).  This is a big deal!  We rehearse weddings, why shouldn&#8217;t we rehearse baptisms?</li>
<li>Be prepared to help people in and out of the baptistery &#8211; they are nervous and distracted, and then wet!  Have someone ready to lend them a hand and hand them a towel.</li>
<li>Depending on how your baptistery is set up, invite family and guests to come to the platform to serve as witnesses (and take photos).  Beyond that, if you can, have the children and teens of the congregation to come up front to see it all.</li>
<li>Have everyone ready to cheer after each one &#8211; this is a big deal and a time of celebration.  Don&#8217;t let people just sit there watching the candidates get wet.</li>
<li>Once in a while, maybe once a year, prior to the baptismal service, preach on baptism.  Tell the congregation why it is a means of grace &#8211; have some of the senior saints ready to share the story of their baptism.  Then, with everyone freshly reminded of how wonderful it is, bring the candidates up!  Wow &#8211; what a great time you will have!</li>
<li>Once you are finished with the baptisms, and depending on your setup, take a bowl of the water from the baptismal and walk through the congregation inviting people to touch the water and &#8220;remember your baptism.&#8221;  If your sanctuary is set up to allow it, you might even have all who will to come forward and touch the water in the baptismal.</li>
<li>Even as you conclude the service, announce that you are ready to meet with others who would like to prepare for baptism.  You might just end up keeping the water for use next Sunday!</li>
</ul>
<p>These are my thoughts&#8230;what are yours?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://localhost/pastorscott.speaking/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/thimbles.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/thimbles-300x207.jpg" alt="thimbles" width="300" height="207" /></a>In my early ministry I remember seeing a grandmother allowing her grandkids to gather around the communion ware and drink all the left over grape juice from the tiny cups.  I think that was the first time I ever thought about the remnants of the communion sacrament.  At the time, I hadn’t thought much about it but there was something about that approach that was disturbing to me.</p>
<p>Coming from a non-liturgical background as I had I’d given little thought to what to do with left over bread and wine (grape juice for us) after the service.  Our Roman Catholic friends, meanwhile, have it down to a fine art but, then, they believe in transubstantiation too – that is that the elements become the actual body and blood of our Lord.  After the mass they are left with consecrated elements that must be handled with utmost reverence.  For Protestants and especially for non-liturgical groups the status of left over elements is something less.   As we celebrate the sacrament concerning the bread and wine we pray: &#8220;Make them by the power of your Spirit to be for us the body and blood of Christ.&#8221;  Having just prayed that prayer a short time earlier, just tossing these things into the trash or down the drain is something akin to handling the Lord’s Supper in an unworthy way.  So what to do?</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are godly people who have thought about this.  After some reading I directed those in our church who prepare the sacrament to this approach; maybe it will help you too.</p>
<p>If we are using the little squares of unleavened bread we return it to the container and put it back in the freezer to be used again.  If we are using baked bread, the portion left over from the actual communion is taken outside to a little used area (like a flower garden) and left for the birds, etc. to consume.  The person taking it out offers a short prayer, thanking the Lord for his sacrifice for us.</p>
<p>Grape juice that has been offered is similarly returned to the earth.  That which was never offered in the service can be drunk as a beverage.</p>
<p>While we don’t accept the concept of transubstantiation we do want to be aware that these elements (that we said are symbols of our Lord’s broken body and shed blood) should be handled in a respectful, reverent way.  You might say that this is a fitting conclusion to a sacrament that emphasizes how common place things can take on uncommon meaning.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter" alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/logo-Pastor_Appreciation_Month-300x165.jpg" width="300" height="165" />Once again we&#8217;re in October, the month set aside in many churches for pastor appreciation.  This is my first October in many years to not be appreciated!  The reason is that I retired last May.  I think this gives me a unique perspective on pastor appreciation month.</p>
<p>Through the years I&#8217;ve been blessed in so many wonderful and undeserved ways by the congregations I&#8217;ve led.  One of my favorite honors was being given tickets to very good seats at a ball game.  Another year we were given a DVD filled with words of appreciation by members of our congregation.  Of course gift cards and cash are always welcome gifts.</p>
<p>I think pastors with children are especially blessed by being given a night out, including babysitting and the cost of a nice meal together.</p>
<p>Thinking in more general ways about pastoral care I think many pastors need to be encouraged to take some time off.   These days most pastors have spouses who work outside the home.  That means that their household seldom, if ever, gets time off together.  Say the spouse works a Monday-Friday job.  However, the pastor&#8217;s busiest days are Saturday and Sunday.  That means they never get a morning to sleep in or enjoy some &#8220;us time&#8221; around the house.  One way to bless your pastor is to arrange for your parsonage family to enjoy a long weekend once in a while.</p>
<p>Finally, I&#8217;ll let you in on a little secret.  Most pastors put a great deal of work into their sermons, Bible studies, etc.  They may not openly admit it, but a lack of interest by their laypeople in this element of their ministry is rather painful.  Pastors notice when ushers receive the offering and then disappear out to the church foyer for the rest of the service (specifically, for the sermon).  They notice when people skip other services, like prayer meetings and Bible studies.  It&#8217;s one thing to give the pastor an appreciation card during the month of October and something much better to allow the pastor to minister to you, fulfilling the calling of God on their life.  One of the best ways to show appreciation for your pastor is to show an interest in their ministry.  Stated rather bluntly, if you appreciate the pastor, stop hurting him or her by displaying a lack of interest in their preaching and teaching ministry.</p>
<p>An old preacher&#8217;s line is &#8220;saying &#8216;amen&#8217; to a preacher is like saying sik&#8217;em to a dog.&#8221;  In the context of pastor appreciation I&#8217;d say that letting your pastor minister to you and then, after the service, shaking his or her hand and telling them that you appreciated their sermon is where pastor appreciation starts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft" alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/lets_make_a_deal_doors.jpg" width="375" height="214" />One thing we&#8217;ve noticed in our months on the road is that church entrances aren&#8217;t especially well marked. I know that people who attend every Sunday don&#8217;t think much about it but it&#8217;s not always as apparent as they might think.</p>
<p>In one place we managed to walk into the sanctuary but there was no foyer and we found ourselves interrupting a Sunday School class in progress. The locals who don&#8217;t attend SS know to enter via the fellowship hall for coffee till church time. Instead, we blundered into the middle of a class. The teacher stopped teaching, everyone turned around, and someone pointed us down the hallway to the official &#8220;waiting&#8221; area.</p>
<p>In another place we sat out in the parking lot hoping someone would arrive so we could follow them in. There were literally 5 entrances to pick from. Then, once we gave up and guessed (correctly) and were inside, we found that most people parked on the opposite side of the church and used an entrance we hadn&#8217;t even seen. I would have sure liked to have used that entrance because it was to a proper foyer. As it was I had to walk across the back of the sanctuary as the service was already underway to go find the men&#8217;s room. Everyone seated near the back of the sanctuary watched me as I looked around to spot the proper door to exit to find the hallway most people used when coming and going.</p>
<p>In another place we parked in the first parking lot we saw, walked clear around the building to find some double glass doors and enter. Once inside we saw that the doors we had parked near provided perfectly acceptable entrance to the opposite side of the foyer. However, there were no signs or other indication of that.</p>
<p>Sometimes the entrance is obvious to anyone. Otherwise, I think every church should at least have signs posted on the main sidewalks pointing to the entrance people are expected to use.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my Zion, the Church of the Nazarene, there&#8217;s a required annual church meeting in which the business of the church is conducted.  I&#8217;m writing with my own denomination in mind but I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if this approach is applicable for other groups as well.</p>
<p>There are several reports to be heard in this meeting: youth, missions, stewards, trustees, treasurer, secretary, and others.  The old way to do it was to set aside a Sunday night for reports and voting.  Frankly, it wasn&#8217;t an inspiring event and a lot of folks opted to do something else that night.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really too bad.  Some of our finest people serve faithfully through the year and the church really does need to hear them tell what they&#8217;ve done.  Hearing them report reminds the congregation of the many things that happen in the church that don&#8217;t take place on the platform on Sunday mornings.</p>
<p>So, here&#8217;s the solution.  During the weeks leading up to the voting, take time each Sunday morning to hear three or so reports.  Ask those reporting to take three or four minutes for their reports.  Following each report, have everyone clap and cheer.</p>
<p>This approach will allow the congregation to focus on each report and not get saturated from hearing one report after another.  It also puts the church leaders up front on a Sunday morning &#8212; giving honor to those to whom honor is due.</p>
<p>Pastors, of all people, understand the importance of highlighting the efforts of dedicated laypeople in the church and this is an excellent way to do it.</p>
