It is actually a bigger project than just sidewalks, as we have a very nice patio type covering in the front of the church, and the brick paving has been put down underneath that awning, creating some very usable space for outdoor activities: everything from overflow space at church dinners to VBS activities to church BBQ&#8217;s. We&#8217;re even thinking of having some outdoor Sunday evening services.<\/p>\n<p>Actually, this blog entry isn&#8217;t as much about that as it is about the wonderful folks I pastor. We have had a number of people who gave up their Friday and Saturday after Thanksgiving and then the following Friday and Saturday again this week to labor on this project. As a pastor, I must say that this is about as encouraging a thing as can be imagined. There&#8217;s a lot of grumbling these days about &#8220;lack of commitment&#8221; by church people. I&#8217;m seeing none of it. These good folks financially support the church and go above and beyond the call of duty in doing it. Then, they give up their days off and vacation days to come and work sun up to sun down to make the church building into a nicer place to worship. I am pleased with and humbled by such generosity.<\/p>\n<div><a href=\"http:\/\/picasa.google.com\/blogger\/\" target=\"ext\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/pbp.gif\" alt=\"Posted by Picasa\" align=\"middle\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A major project at our church has been the replacing of old, inadequate concrete sidewalks with brick paving.
