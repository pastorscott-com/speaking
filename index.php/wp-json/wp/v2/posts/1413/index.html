I spent hours playing it on my Atari system.  Rows of \u201caliens\u201d marched back and forth across the screen while I shot at them, blowing them away for the sake of dear old planet earth.<\/p>\n<p>The graphics weren\u2019t much to look at in those days, but as I recall, the actual \u201cinvaders\u201d could have been most anything.  The only reason I thought of them as I did was the name of the game.  They could have been leaves falling from the sky or a marching band so far as the graphics were concerned.  However, it felt more reasonable to blast away at \u201cspace invaders\u201d than it would have felt to blast away at, say, baby ducks following the mother duck to the pond!<\/p>\n<p>I see a lot of \u201cSpace Invaders\u201d being played in the church world. Folks take sides and then apply a convenient label to those with whom they disagree.  Once we\u2019ve done that, they\u2019re no longer brothers and sisters in Christ.  Instead they\u2019re \u201cliberals\u201d or \u201ctraditionalists\u201d or \u201cemergents\u201d or \u201cfundamentalists.\u201d  In my circles, I\u2019m told that what someone teaches is \u201cCatholic\u201d or \u201cCalvinist.\u201d  Once the label is applied, we\u2019re free to load up and take aim.  After all, we\u2019re no longer shooting at sons and daughters of our Heavenly Father.  These are \u201cinvaders\u201d and we\u2019re trying to blow \u2018em away in the Name of Jesus.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the lost people, watching from a distance can\u2019t make heads or tales of it all.  To them a Christian is a Christian is a Christian and they can\u2019t tell a Pentecostal from a Presbyterian.  They don\u2019t know much about the Bible, but somehow, they\u2019ve decided that if there\u2019s anything to this \u201cfollowing Jesus\u201d business that the followers will at least love one another rather than try to destroy each other.<\/p>\n<p>John 13:34-35 &#8220;A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Do you remember when the game \u201cSpace Invaders\u201d first came out?
