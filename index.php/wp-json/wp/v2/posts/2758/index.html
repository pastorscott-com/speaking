In the old days, every pastor on the district was required to give a verbal report to the Assembly. Some of the reports were inspiring and some not so much. At some point through the years Mom started &#8220;grading&#8221; pastors. If she liked the way the pastor reported she would put a mark beside their name. She explained that if it so happened that during the year our church went through a pastoral transition (and it happened a lot during those days &#8211; the average pastoral tenure at that time was less than three years) she would use her star system to vet potential candidates.<\/p>\n<p>Honestly, I don&#8217;t know that it ever happened that way, but she was ready &#8211; just in case.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/facebook-mobile-app-820x4201.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-2761 size-thumbnail\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/facebook-mobile-app-820x4201-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a>As I remember her approach I realize that we do something similar with Facebook these days. In the past few years I&#8217;ve been involved in a couple of churches going through a change of pastors. Both times, as soon a potential candidate&#8217;s name became known a significant number of people headed for Facebook to find out all they could about the candidate.<\/p>\n<p>And, using Facebook in particular and Google in general, you can find out a lot about a person. Some things are really easy to see and others take a bit of digging, but if a person is even marginally Facebook savvy they can learn a lot about someone who posts on Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not discounting the spiritual in the least here. For years I&#8217;ve encouraged church people to see a pastoral search as a spiritual rather than business endeavour. Still, I think church people are probably wise to use this to their advantage, at least in the early part of the process. We all know that resumes don&#8217;t tell the whole story. If a pastor is active on Facebook it is easy to get a more candid look at how they interact with people and what interests them when they are &#8220;off the clock.&#8221; This, I think, can help churches find a good match when they are looking for a new pastor.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>My mother was a regular delegate to District Assembly (it&#8217;s a Nazarene thing).
