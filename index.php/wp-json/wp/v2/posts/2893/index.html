maybe other keyboard instruments (in interest of full disclosure, I play bass guitar whenever I am asked)<\/li>\n<li>There are singers with microphones who sing with energy<\/li>\n<li>The words are on the screen<\/li>\n<li>Everyone is standing anytime there is music being played<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>So far so good.\u00a0 We have music being played &#8211; generally well played.\u00a0 We have leaders who are singing out.\u00a0 We have the words and, most often, a repeatable melody.<\/p>\n<p>But very few people are singing.\u00a0 Usually, the church leaders are really into it: hands and faces raised in worship.\u00a0 Scattered around the congregation are others who are singing along.\u00a0 However, they are the minority.\u00a0 My most generous estimate is that 1 in 10 worshipers are singing.\u00a0 Everyone else is just standing there.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe that&#8217;s not all bad.\u00a0 Maybe they are carefully listening to the words, reading them on the screen and being deeply moved by it all.\u00a0 I don&#8217;t know their hearts and I understand that it&#8217;s really none of my business.\u00a0 My business is to be in the moment, turning my thoughts and spirit away from the mundane things of life and focusing on the Lord.<\/p>\n<p>However, my hip starts aching after a while and it starts feeling to me like we&#8217;re saying the same words over and over again.\u00a0 I can&#8217;t help but wonder how much longer we&#8217;re going linger at this particular stage of worship.<\/p>\n<p>So, I start looking around, being impressed by the sincerity of the folks who are, apparently, really into the worship service.\u00a0 But I also note that a lot of folks are just standing there like me.<\/p>\n<p>I know I&#8217;m one of the senior citizens now and the old people always complain that things used to be better &#8211; longing for the good old days.\u00a0 I don&#8217;t want to be one of those people. \u00a0 I think the point could be made that people just don&#8217;t sing any more.\u00a0 Rather, they go to concerts, stand and listen while people on stage do the singing.\u00a0 I&#8217;m convinced that the concert goers aren&#8217;t there for a show, and they really do worship.\u00a0 Maybe when those concert goers go to church they treat the worship service as another Christian music concert.\u00a0 They are there to worship but not to sing.<\/p>\n<p>Still, I keep going back to a worship service we attended\u00a0 in a large church a couple of years ago.\u00a0 We were near the front, center and, yes, we were standing for the whole song service.\u00a0 There was a Praise Band and singers with microphones and words on the screens.\u00a0 There was also a pipe organ and grand piano.\u00a0 And we were singing a 250 year old Wesley hymn.<\/p>\n<p>The congregation was singing their hearts out.\u00a0 At first I joined in, singing bass as best I could.\u00a0 Then I became overwhelmed and had to stop singing.\u00a0 I just stood there letting the sound of all the voices wash over me.<\/p>\n<p>I miss being part of a congregation that sings like that.<\/p>\n<p>And, by the way, my hip didn&#8217;t hurt at all that day.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It seems to me that church people don&#8217;t sing like they used to.
