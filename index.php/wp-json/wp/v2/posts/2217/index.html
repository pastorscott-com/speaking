it speaks of not caring, not being organized, and of neglect.<\/li>\n<li>If you aren&#8217;t going to keep the site current then DON&#8217;T post any current events.\u00a0 Turn the website into a billboard for the church with only static information including some of the things I&#8217;m about to list.<\/li>\n<li>Post your service times and make them easy to find.<\/li>\n<li>Post your church address and include directions.\u00a0 It&#8217;s amazing how many church websites never bother to name their state.\u00a0 Put complete directions, and make them easy to find.<\/li>\n<li>If you want to do more, a really nice thing to do is include some photos, especially of the church in worship.\u00a0 My wife often wonders what the ladies wear to church.\u00a0 She knows that we will be welcome even if we don&#8217;t quite meet the local dress code, but she wants to fit in.\u00a0 Photos of people in a regular worship service help a lot.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Remember, people DO look you up on the Internet.\u00a0 Don&#8217;t just have a Facebook page &#8211; not everyone can see it.\u00a0 DON&#8217;T let someone&#8217;s nephew who is a whizbang at doing fancy webpages do yours.\u00a0 It needs to look on purpose and grown up.\u00a0 Simple with relevant information is better than impressive and out of date because no one who actually cares about the church&#8217;s image has a clue as to how to update the page and the nephew is long gone.\u00a0 You can have a reasonable, easy to maintain, easy to Google website for very little money.\u00a0 Really, trust me, you NEED a website that meets at least certain minimum standards.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>These days Jackie and I are enjoying visiting lots of different churches.\u00a0 Every week or two we are in a different place and ready to join some congregation in worship.\u00a0 Being Nazarenes our first choice is one of our own tribe although I am quick to add that we&#8217;ve enjoyed fellowship in a variety of [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[623,4],"tags":[229,267,282,397,431],"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2217"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2217"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2217\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":3587,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2217\/revisions\/3587"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2217"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2217"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2217"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
