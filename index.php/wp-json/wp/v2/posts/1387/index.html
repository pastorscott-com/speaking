In spite of the old \u201csticks and stones\u201d rhyme, the fact is that words can hurt, especially if they\u2019re skillfully stated or made in public.  What are we to think of the person who says such things?<\/p>\n<p>Jesus gives us an insight into the matter when he says:<em> \u201cBut the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and these make a man \u2018unclean.\u2019 For out of the heart come\u2026false testimony, slander.\u201d<\/em> (Matthew 15:18-19)<\/p>\n<p>He tells us that words flow from the heart.  The kinds of things a person says tells us the kind of person they are.  Unclean words come, he says, from an unclean heart.  If I go to a cesspool and find filthy water flowing out of it I shouldn\u2019t be surprised.  After all, consider the source.<\/p>\n<p>However, I think there\u2019s further application to be made from this teaching of Jesus.  I think hurtful words often flow from an injured heart.  An individual who\u2019s in emotional pain will often speak or maybe write hurtful things to or about others.  A person who feels they\u2019ve been mistreated or judged unfairly and then cherishes that sense of injustice will start producing words of injustice of their own.  After all, they\u2019re filled with and being consumed by indignation.  The result is verbal or written anger and injustice.<\/p>\n<p>So what do we do when we\u2019re falsely accused of telling lies or in some other way find ourselves the target of such abuse?  When Jesus describes the source of \u201cunclean\u201d words he tells his disciples that <em>\u201cEvery plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be pulled up by the roots. Leave them; they are blind guides.\u201d <\/em>(Matthew 15:13-14)<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s interesting that elsewhere Jesus says that when there\u2019s disagreement in the Church that we\u2019re to go to one another and work things out.  However, when we\u2019re dealing with unclean words coming from unclean hearts we\u2019re to leave it up to the heavenly Father to handle the weeding.  If we respond, we\u2019re likely playing into their hands and just throwing gasoline on the fire.  Instead, we\u2019re to focus on doing the right thing and let God handle things.<\/p>\n<p>In the case of \u201churt causing hurt\u201d I think we need to tread very carefully.  In spite of the fact that we\u2019ve been unfairly chosen as a target the truth is that it really doesn\u2019t have much to do with us.  Instead, we just happen to be at the wrong place at the wrong time.  Some people are so wounded that they\u2019re equal opportunity wound-ers.  The only answer may be to just take it.  (Note: I\u2019m not talking about physical abuse here.)  Frankly, I think its okay to feel pity for them.  However, unless you want to double their fury you\u2019d better keep your pity toward them to yourself.  They\u2019re hurting at heart a lot more than they\u2019re hurting you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Have you ever had someone unjustly accuse you of being a liar or who says hurtful things to you or about you?
