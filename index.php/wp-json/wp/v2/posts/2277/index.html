It was one year ago this Sunday that I preached my final sermon as a pastor and said farewell to our wonderful congregation. We turned the page to a new chapter in our lives.<\/p>\n<p>While I doubt that I will ever quit being a pastor at heart, I\u2019ve begun to learn to go to church and sit in a pew. I\u2019ve been learning what it means to go to church and have no responsibility other than to worship. I\u2019d almost forgotten what that was like. For me church attendance was filled with responsibilities. I gave my all on Sundays and came home weary and, quite often satisfied. These days I come home less weary and less satisfied. Going to church no longer has \u201cwork\u201d associated with it but it doesn\u2019t carry with it the satisfaction only a pastor enjoys after an especially blessed Sunday morning.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, Jackie and I didn\u2019t retire in a normal way. The day after my last Sunday we headed out on a great adventure, traveling the country in our RV. It\u2019s been a great year and we hope it has been the first of what will be many.<\/p>\n<p>During the past year I stopped carrying an ink pen in my pocket. That meant I could shop for shirts without pockets for the first time in years. It took several months, but I finally stopped wearing a watch. I have a sun tan instead of a white band around my wrist! During the year Jackie and my mornings have morphed into a leisurely time punctuated by a long coffee break about 10:00 each day. Then, many evenings have been spent sitting outside watching the sky; counting the satellites that glide overhead. We\u2019ve even seen a good number of shooting stars. We\u2019re enjoying each other\u2019s company in ways that were almost forgotten.<\/p>\n<p>We aren\u2019t quite there yet but we\u2019re rediscovering something we haven\u2019t experienced since childhood: the joy of doing nothing. Don\u2019t get me wrong: we do a lot. We\u2019ve gone sightseeing, taken hikes, and visited museums and National Parks. However, mixed in now, are days of reading or just fooling with the computer. There are times to just sit and watch the world go by; or blow an evening watching TV. Over the winter, when it was unusually old outside, we watched the entire Star Wars series, from beginning to end, every night for six nights in a row. No meetings to attend, no need to bundle up and go out and fight the weather or the traffic \u2013 just time to do what we wanted to do, which was, at that particular moment: nothing.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve missed having family close by. Most people retire and spend more time with loved ones. We, in our own crazy way, retired and immediately traveled far from them. That absent time, though, was somewhat balanced out by the months when we were close by and available to them as never before.<\/p>\n<p>So, here I am, one year into retirement. When anyone asks me how I\u2019m enjoying retirement I generally respond with the quip that had I known it was this much fun, I would have done it 30 years ago. There\u2019s no small amount of truth to it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Time flies.
