Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel!&#8221;<\/em> (1 Corinthians 9:16). The anchor of our preaching must be the Good News of Jesus. It is so easy to get drawn into social commentary or political concerns or something similar. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, there&#8217;s a time and place to address current issues. However, they must always be addressed in the context of the Gospel message. &#8220;Our nation believes thus-and-so but, in Christ, the Lord offers us a better way.&#8221; It is so easy for the preacher to use pulpit time to denounce everything that is wrong while neglecting the hope that Jesus brings to the world. In the 1 Corinthians passage Paul is challenging the church&#8217;s treatment of himself. They have taken him for granted and even accused him of trying to boss them around. Paul defends himself, but also states, <em>&#8220;we put up with anything rather than hinder the gospel of Christ.&#8221;<\/em> For him, it is all about getting the Good News out. Pastor don&#8217;t squander your pulpit time on other stuff. When you do point out sin in society do so only to offer hope for the sinner. Our calling is clear: preach the Gospel.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/12\/notredame.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-large wp-image-1835\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/12\/notredame.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Apostle Paul said: &#8220;For when I preach the gospel, I cannot boast, since I am compelled to preach.
