That, though, had some limitations &#8212; really, not all preachable portions of Scripture lend themselves to the reading of Scripture in worship service.<\/p>\n<p>Also, I was still challenged to lift the Scripture, itself. If I read my text early, I was really still reading it as part of the sermon. I wanted to let the Scripture, at that point, just speak for itself and be separate from the sermon.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, I decided to go with at least a portion of the Gospel reading from the Book of Common Prayer. It gives us a bit of structure and a certain flow week by week.
