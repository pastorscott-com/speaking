I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m exaggerating when I say that it is fairly common for the &#8220;call to worship&#8221; to include some kind of commentary on football! It is always done in a light touch and a smile and I understand the pastor&#8217;s desire to appear relevant to current events. Honestly, I&#8217;d rather hear that than some kind of political comment (and, yes, I&#8217;ve heard that too).<\/p>\n<p>Listen, I like football and sports in general. I like talking about it with my friends. But when I go to church my focus is on something else &#8212; Someone else. Start the service off with something spiritual; maybe a reminder that we are gathering for a serious purpose. That&#8217;s not to say we don&#8217;t come with joy and expectation &#8211; or that we don&#8217;t enjoy fellowship with one another. Of course we do.<\/p>\n<p>It seems to me many of us are already struggling to get our minds off of a thousand other things as we come to worship. Instead of legitimizing the trivial how about reading a powerful passage of scripture and reminding worshipers that we serve an awesome God and that we are, right now, coming into his presence?<\/p>\n<p>I have to admit that I didn&#8217;t arrive at this opinion early in my ministry. In fact, as a young pastor I let the song leader (that&#8217;s what we called them back in the old days) get up and announce the first song. This without any input from me at all. As time passed I began to think about how we were beginning our worship services and decided that some of our high church friends were on to something with their liturgical calls to worship.<\/p>\n<p>I started seeking out scriptures that called people into worship and began opening services with scripture and prayer. It may just be my imagination but I think the services took on a more Christ-centered atmosphere.<\/p>\n<p>Now, all the above, I know, must be taken with a strong dose of common sense. When the home town team is playing the Super Bowl there&#8217;s room for some level of public commentary. Also, there&#8217;s a lot of good sermon illustrations in the world of sports. Still, that kind of stuff has a very limited shelf life and should be used sparingly.<\/p>\n<p>This is, of course, all just my opinion. Still, pastor, it might be reasonable to consider how to best invite people to enter into a spirit of worship.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We visit a lot of churches so we have a fairly large sample size to draw from.
