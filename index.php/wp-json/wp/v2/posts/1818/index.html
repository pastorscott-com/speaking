Talk about the kind of pastor you aspire to be and the kind of church you want to pastor.  Make it a Biblical, scripture-based sermon, but at the same time, share your heart with the congregation.<\/p>\n<p>A year after you arrive, on your anniversary Sunday, preach that same sermon again.  Let it remind you and them of what your ministry is all about.<\/p>\n<p>Then, as years pass, you probably won&#8217;t preach that sermon annually, but every two or three years get it out, update it, and preach it again.  It will be good for you to restate your hopes as a pastor.  It will also be good for your congregation to be reminded of what you told them you would do (or not do) as their pastor.  It will help new people get on board as they better understand what you and the church are about.
