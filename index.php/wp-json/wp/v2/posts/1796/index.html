If you can preach about our victory in Christ \u2013 make the sermon about Jesus. If you emphasize comfort in grief \u2013 make the sermon about the Lord\u2019s willingness to comfort even in times of loss.<\/li>\n<li>Do use the person\u2019s life in illustrations \u2013 include some heartwarming memory or some conversation or something that connects them to your sermon. Caution: don\u2019t make the sermon about your relationship with the person. That does more to impress people that you\u2019re a wonderful person than it causes them to remember that we have a wonderful Lord.<\/li>\n<li>Remember that a funeral sermon is an opportunity to minister to people who are thinking about life and death \u2013 and often they are people who don\u2019t hear many sermons. If you can point them to Jesus as our hope and comfort you might move them a step closer to coming to Christ.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Here\u2019s my advice to young pastors concerning funeral sermons: You need to develop at least five different sermons\u2026although some can be just variations of another A sermon for a saint who lived long and well A sermon for a younger person who lived for the Lord but died too young A sermon for a person [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[623,4],"tags":[15,171,306],"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1796"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1796"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1796\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":3577,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1796\/revisions\/3577"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1796"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1796"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1796"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
