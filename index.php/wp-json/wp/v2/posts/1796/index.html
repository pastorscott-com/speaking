Caution: don\u2019t make the sermon about your relationship      with the person.  That does more to impress people that you\u2019re a wonderful      person than it causes them to remember that we have a wonderful Lord.<\/li>\n<li>Remember that a funeral sermon is an opportunity to      minister to people who are thinking about life and death \u2013 and often they      are people who don\u2019t hear many sermons.  If you can point them to Jesus as      our hope and comfort you might move them a step closer to coming to      Christ.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Here\u2019s my advice to young pastors concerning funeral sermons: You need to develop at least five different sermons\u2026although some can be just variations of another A sermon for a saint who lived long and well A sermon for a younger person who lived for the Lord but died too young A sermon for a person [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[623,4],"tags":[15,171,306],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1796"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1796"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1796\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1800,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1796\/revisions\/1800"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1796"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1796"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1796"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
