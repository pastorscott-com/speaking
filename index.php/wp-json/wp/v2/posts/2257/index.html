church\u201d worship environment.\u00a0 Our Nazarene Manual directed us to receive the Lord\u2019s Supper at least once a quarter and, apparently, we saw that as a maximum rather than minimum frequency.\u00a0\u00a0 As a young pastor I followed that same schedule but over time I moved to a monthly observance, trying to find a middle way between seeing the sacrament as the featured act of worship at one extreme, and as a mandated add-on at the other extreme.<\/p>\n<p>While I don\u2019t think there is a right or wrong approach in how most churches observe the sacrament I do think that the freedom to vary the emphasis and approach and even mechanics of observing it can be an advantage for less liturgical churches. \u00a0\u00a0Whether or not you agree with me here, I hope you\u2019ll find some of these thoughts helpful.<\/p>\n<p><b>Communion is more of a celebration than anything else.<\/b>\u00a0 We don\u2019t believe Jesus dies again each time we receive communion and it isn\u2019t only about shed blood and broken body.\u00a0\u00a0 Mainly, we\u2019re celebrating the amazing love the Lord has for us.\u00a0\u00a0 Jesus willingly went to the cross because \u201cGod so loved the world.\u201d\u00a0 There, on that old rugged cross, he conquered sin and death.\u00a0 His victory has become mine.\u00a0 We don\u2019t celebrate the brokenness and bleeding but we do celebrate the reason for it and what it has accomplished in and for us. <i>\u00a0\u201cWe come today to celebrate the greatest act of love, the most beneficial sacrifice ever accomplished\u2026.\u201d<\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>Communion is the perfect platform for inviting people to come to Jesus. <\/b>\u00a0As a young person I somehow had the idea that the Lord\u2019s Supper could be hazardous to one\u2019s health.\u00a0 We were to examine ourselves and if we had experienced any spiritual failure we might be wise to skip communion that quarter.\u00a0 Over time I began to understand that, while it was possible to receive communion in an unworthy manner (that is, without showing proper reverence) that, honestly, no one is worthy of receiving these emblems of the Lord\u2019s body and blood.\u00a0 Had we been worthy, he would have never had to go to the cross in the first place.\u00a0 With that in mind, I began to see the sacrament as an invitation to Christ.\u00a0 As I examine my heart and realize that there are spiritual failures I\u2019m not disqualified from the bread and wine.\u00a0 Rather, I\u2019m being given an opportunity to avail myself of the mercy and grace of the Lord in a fresh way. \u00a0If I come, viewing my receiving communion as a substitute for repentance and faith I\u2019m moving into the \u201cunworthy\u201d territory.\u00a0 If I come seeking forgiveness and restoration, though, I find life in that sacrament.\u00a0 <i>\u201cThe Bible says we\u2019re to examine ourselves before receiving communion.\u00a0 So let\u2019s do that.\u00a0 If, as you consider your relationship with the Lord and find that things aren\u2019t what they ought to be, that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t receive communion today.\u00a0 Instead, this is an opportunity to make things right with the Lord.\u00a0 As you receive the bread and wine, receive Jesus into your life all over again.\u201d<\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>Communion is a great way to introduce your child to Jesus.<\/b>\u00a0 Honestly, I think our liturgical friends with their emphasis on \u201cfirst communion\u201d have a great approach.\u00a0 However, that doesn\u2019t mean that there aren\u2019t advantages to a less structured, low church approach.\u00a0 As a pastor I allowed parents to bring their children forward to receive communion provided the parent agreed to have a discussion with that child about allowing Jesus to be their Lord and Savior before the day was over.\u00a0 Symbols are powerful and children can grasp spiritual realities earlier than we might think.\u00a0 I let parents decide if their children are \u201cthere\u201d yet.\u00a0 <i>\u201cParents, I\u2019ll let you decide when your children are ready to receive communion.\u00a0 If you do allow your child to come today, I ask this of you: let\u2019s agree that before this day is over you will sit down with your child and talk about the meaning of communion and how it is that a person places their faith in Jesus.\u201d<\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>Communion ought to be the focus of at least one service a year.<\/b>\u00a0 Baptism has been called the \u201centry sacrament\u201d to our life in Christ.\u00a0 Communion is the \u201ccontinuing sacrament.\u201d\u00a0 One Sunday a year the church service should be all about the Lord\u2019s Supper (World Communion Sunday is the first Sunday of October).\u00a0\u00a0 Sing songs about it, read the appropriate scriptures, and preach a sermon that reminds us why we celebrate communion.\u00a0 Talk about our unity with believers across the ages and in the various traditions of Christianity.\u00a0 Talk about God\u2019s love for us and Christ\u2019s willingness to die for us.\u00a0 Remind people of its connection to the Marriage Supper of the Lamb.\u00a0 Tell them why the Lord\u2019s Supper is called a \u201cmeans of grace.\u201d\u00a0 Then, invite people to the table of the Lord.\u00a0 Pastor, on this Sunday, you do all the serving, taking the role of Jesus, himself.\u00a0 <i>\u201cToday is World Communion Sunday and we\u2019re going to join Christians of many traditions around the world in receiving communion.\u00a0 Before we do that though, let\u2019s think about the meaning and purpose of this sacrament of the Church.\u201d<\/i><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I grew up in
