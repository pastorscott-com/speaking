That changed sermons from being, to a large part, translating Shakespearean language to modern English for our listeners to being more focused on the meaning of the text itself.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Another big change was the addition of video to preaching<\/strong>. I know some pastors have yet to move toward it, but the vast majority of our churches have video up at least for scriptures, but often preaching is supplemented by professionally produced videos and clips from popular culture.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A more subtle change is that our listeners now consume a wide variety of teaching<\/strong> ranging from TV and radio preachers to reading books or listening to podcasts from a variety of theological perspectives. This is a major change from the day when the local pastor was the primary source of teaching to those in the congregation. I&#8217;ve heard fine lay people repeat stuff that it is clearly incompatible with our doctrines. They&#8217;d heard it somewhere, and just accepted it because the speaker is a well known, capable teacher.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I think, though, that the biggest change is the move away from Sunday night services.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As I&#8217;ve just been saying, the pastor&#8217;s voice is diminished in the lives of church attenders already. So, while people are consuming a variety of religious teaching through the week, most pastors only address their congregations on Sunday mornings during the sermon. That limits the pastor&#8217;s influence over the congregation.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not saying, though, that this change is necessarily a bad thing. It was late in my active ministry that our church yielded to the reality that most people simply didn&#8217;t want to attend a Sunday night service. And it was only with that change in the church schedule that I had a taste of Sunday being a Christian Sabbath. For many years of my ministry I came to Sunday night exhausted. The concept that the pastor should take a different day as a day of rest never really worked for me. My weekly &#8220;day off&#8221; was filled with the kinds of things that most everyone does on their days off and not especially restful. I came to greatly appreciate Sunday afternoons as a time to unwind without needing to &#8220;reload&#8221; for the Sunday evening service.<\/p>\n<p>Beyond that, being able to focus on Sunday morning only made me, I think, a better preacher. All my preparation time was toward one sermon. For non-preachers this may not sound like much but I think most preachers who read this will agree that focusing on one sermon a week makes a huge difference in preaching.<\/p>\n<p>Of all the changes I&#8217;ve seen, I think the elimination of Sunday night church is the biggest.<\/p>\n<p>What do you think?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I was just thinking about the biggest single change I&#8217;ve seen in my 45 years of ministry.
