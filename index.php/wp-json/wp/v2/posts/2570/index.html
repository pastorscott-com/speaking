\u00a0Let them get into the baptistery when it is dry and see what you expect of them (and yourself). \u00a0This is a big deal! \u00a0We rehearse weddings, why shouldn&#8217;t we rehearse baptisms?<\/li>\n<li>Be prepared to help people in and out of the baptistery &#8211; they are nervous and distracted, and then wet! \u00a0Have someone ready to lend them a hand and hand them a towel.<\/li>\n<li>Depending on how your baptistery is set up, invite family and guests to come to the platform to serve as witnesses (and take photos). \u00a0Beyond that, if you can, have the children and teens of the congregation to come up front to see it all.<\/li>\n<li>Have everyone ready to cheer after each one &#8211; this is a big deal and a time of celebration. \u00a0Don&#8217;t let people just sit there watching the candidates get wet.<\/li>\n<li>Once in a while, maybe once a year, prior to the baptismal service, preach on baptism. \u00a0Tell the congregation why it is a means of grace &#8211; have some of the senior saints ready to share the story of their baptism. \u00a0Then, with everyone freshly reminded of how wonderful it is, bring the candidates up! \u00a0Wow &#8211; what a great time you will have!<\/li>\n<li>Once you are finished with the baptisms, and depending on your setup, take a bowl of the water from the baptismal and walk through the congregation inviting people to touch the water and &#8220;remember your baptism.&#8221; \u00a0If your sanctuary is set up to allow it, you might even have all who will to come forward and touch the water in the baptismal.<\/li>\n<li>Even as you conclude the service, announce that you are ready to meet with others who would like to prepare for baptism. \u00a0You might just end up keeping the water for use next Sunday!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These are my thoughts&#8230;what are yours?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Coming from a low church background I had very little pastoral training for conducting baptisms. \u00a0Also, in spite of my denomination&#8217;s acceptance of infant baptism, it was never practiced in the portions of the country where I grew up or ministered &#8211; everywhere I served people wanted to get wet all over and that&#8217;s what [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[623,4],"tags":[15,618,82,301,305,458],"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2570"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2570"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2570\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":3591,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2570\/revisions\/3591"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2570"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2570"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2570"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
