We\u2019ve thoroughly enjoyed this experience which allowed us to do some very interesting things while being close to family and friends.\u00a0 While we\u2019re more than ready to begin our travels again we enjoyed the volunteering experience enough that we\u2019ve already signed up to do it again next year.<\/p>\n<p>I did a few more clergy-like things than I did our first year but not a lot.\u00a0 I filled for our pastor when he was away, filled in for our Sunday School teacher (who happens to be my son) when he was away, did a baby dedication, and finalized <a href=\"http:\/\/pastorscott.com\/index.php\/books-by-pastor-scott\/\">my series of books of devotionals<\/a>.\u00a0 Aside from that I\u2019ve happily sat in the pew, appreciating the ministry of others.<\/p>\n<p>All in all, we\u2019ve spent over 4 months in the Houston area during this stay.\u00a0 That means we suspended our \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/pastorscott.com\/travel\/church-hopping-observations\/\">church hopping<\/a>\u201d ways and settled into a more typical church attendance routine.\u00a0 While visiting many different churches during our travels is enjoyable we\u2019ve missed the sense of community associated with being a part of a congregation.\u00a0 This being our second winter as part of our home church helped us feel more a part of things.\u00a0 It\u2019s interesting to me how things we at first felt were somehow different become, in just a few weeks, just \u201cthe way it is done here.\u201d\u00a0 One thing that become increasingly clear is that no church can be evaluated in just a week or two.\u00a0 Churches have personalities and that personality isn\u2019t apparent until one is part of the congregation (and involved beyond an hour on Sunday mornings) for a while.\u00a0 Don\u2019t get me wrong: I enjoy visiting churches, but I know that being a regular, contributing part of a church\u00a0<span style=\"color: #444444;\">family is superior.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>So, I\u2019d say retirement is going quite well, thank you!\u00a0 We\u2019re well aware that we are blessed to live this life and we don\u2019t take it for granted.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Wow, retirement anniversary number two.\u00a0 It was the first Sunday of May, 2013 that we concluded our pastoral ministry and entered into retirement.\u00a0 In our case, we retired to travel and the very next day we drove off with our RV, starting the next primary chapter of our lives.
