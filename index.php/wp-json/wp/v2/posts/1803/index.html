Preachers are notorious for getting tongues tangled &#8212; for foot-in-mouth disease.  A friend of mine made a huge goof one time that had the congregation so ticked that he good-naturedly just closed the service!<\/p>\n<p>I was once praying a sincere prayer and heard myself devoutly pray: &#8220;Oh, Lord, we come to you in true humidity.&#8221;  Along the Texas Gulf Coast that may be more true than what I intended to say in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>Last Sunday as I preached a sermon on Lot&#8217;s wife, I commented that we don&#8217;t know the names of all the women in the Bible and we don&#8217;t know her&#8217;s.  Then, somewhere early in her story I said something like, &#8220;Lot&#8217;s wife husband,  Lot, decided to join his uncle in his journey.&#8221;  Even as I said it I  got tickled.  Yep, Lot&#8217;s wife&#8217;s husband was named Lot all right.  It  took me a minute or so to get my act back together.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, we don&#8217;t know Mrs. Lot&#8217;s name&#8230;but I&#8217;m quite sure that Lot&#8217;s wife&#8217;s husband was named Lot.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes, you just have to laugh at yourself, pick up the pieces, and move on the best you can.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I know that preaching is serious business and I take it seriously.
