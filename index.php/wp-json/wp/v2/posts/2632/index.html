That&#8217;s especially true when we visit churches outside our own Zion, but often even different churches of our own denomination have approaches to things that are new to us.<\/p>\n<p>We visited one church in which the bulletin directed us to receive the elements whenever we wanted upon receiving them. They passed the trays and most everyone received them immediately. Those in the front of the church got theirs first, received them, and then waited for the service to continue. I didn&#8217;t like that very much because it seemed to take the &#8220;union&#8221; out of comm-union for me.<\/p>\n<p>Other churches may instruct people to wait for further instructions but they have a congregational song going throughout the distribution of elements. At one place the minister was almost shouting over the praise band, instructing us to &#8220;take and eat.&#8221; I found myself wanting to say &#8220;hush!&#8221; to the singers so I could not only contemplate what the Lord did and is doing for me but also hear what the minister was saying.<\/p>\n<p>Since I believe this sacrament is, indeed, &#8220;a means of grace&#8221; I want to be given a bit of spiritual space when I receive it. Time spent holding the symbols of our Lord&#8217;s broken body and shed blood while others are being served is one way that can happen. Also, some quiet time, maybe with just some soft instrumental music, helps me listen to the &#8220;still, small voice&#8221; of God.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Traveling as we do we see different approaches to the elements of worship.
