Rather, it&#8217;s just the way it is.<\/p>\n<p>Second, you&#8217;re in this for the long haul. The dedicated, burning-the-candle-at-both-ends kind of pastor will get lots of applause from some in the congregation and maybe will even be &#8220;honored&#8221; by being asked to take on yet more responsibilities at the community, district, or denominational level. It&#8217;s important to remember that some of these good people will applaud you right into the grave. If your ministry is going to last a lifetime, it needs to be run at a jog rather than at a sprint.<\/p>\n<p>Third, life is short and there&#8217;s no rewind button. Your kids (and then grandkids) grow up quickly. Your relationship with your loved ones needs attention. Also, while a quiet lifestyle is practically unheard of these days, for a person seeking God&#8217;s heart it&#8217;s vitally important. A less intense lifestyle may produce a spiritual depth that will flow in natural ways into your ministry&#8230;accomplishing more genuine ministry to others than a frantic run on some church schedule treadmill seven days a week.<\/p>\n<p>Fourth, beware of letting others set your schedule. One group thinks you need to attend every church event (years ago the ladies at the womens meeting actually asked Jackie if I was coming &#8211; after all the previous pastor had always stuck his head in the door for their meetings &#8211; she laughed and said they had better not expect me). A certain age group would be happy if you took on the role specifically given to the laypeople of the church and spent a lot of time ministering to the &#8220;widows.&#8221; Others will make you their father confessor and lock you into a brutal counseling session schedule. If you like that stuff, okay, maybe. However, the pastor needs to have a strong sense of self identity and not let others control the schedule. (By the way, I don&#8217;t think the pastor should give a detailed time report to the board for just that reason &#8211; you&#8217;ll never win because they all think they know what you&#8217;re supposed to do with your time.)<\/p>\n<p>As I&#8217;ve already mentioned, I don&#8217;t think the pastor&#8217;s situation is greatly different than that of many other professionals and business owners. I guess a case could be made that since we&#8217;re dealing with people at a spiritual level and since we believe eternity is, indeed, forever, that there&#8217;s a bit more pressure, but I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s actually in play at a practical level.<\/p>\n<p>Take some time off&#8230;not just for vacation time, or even a day or two a week &#8220;off,&#8221; but every day. Don&#8217;t be ashamed or apologetic. Go toss the ball around with your kids. You and your spouse go for a long no-church-business-discussed walk. Watch some TV or read a nothing-to-do-with-church book. Sit around thinking about the things of God, not for a sermon, but just so you&#8217;ll understand such things better. \u00a0 In the long run, you&#8217;ll likely do more for the Kingdom that way.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I have four things to say to pastors about &#8220;days off&#8221; and how, in general, a pastor spends his or her time.
