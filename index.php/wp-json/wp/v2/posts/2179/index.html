lots of doom and gloom. \u00a0Reading aloud made me feel somewhat depressed. \u00a0On a practical level, I realized how repetitive some of those writings are. \u00a0The prophet says something one way, then he repeats it another way, and then does it all over again. \u00a0Doing it out loud made that somehow more obvious to me than before.<\/p>\n<p>Another challenge is names. \u00a0Some portions, in Numbers for instance, are lists of names. \u00a0Many of the prophets spend a lot of time with names of towns. \u00a0I cut myself just a bit of slack on the names. \u00a0If I didn&#8217;t immediately recognize the name I&#8217;d just say the first letter of the name and keep reading: &#8220;A son of Z, son of Benjamin.&#8221; \u00a0I guess that was cheating a bit, but since no one was listening but me I decided it was a reasonable course of action.<\/p>\n<p>One thing about all those names of people and places, was that it reminded me of just how grounded those stories are in history. \u00a0These are real people and real places. \u00a0I know it because the writer named names.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t suggest that everyone ought to do this. \u00a0Many people just need to read the Bible; to get on a plan and stick with it. \u00a0The more you read the more you come to love the Bible. \u00a0If you haven&#8217;t been reading the Bible, just commit yourself to one page a day. \u00a0Start with the Gospels. \u00a0Make it easy on yourself. \u00a0Some start off in Genesis, enjoy the opening stories and then can&#8217;t make it through Exodus not to mention Leviticus. \u00a0When you are ready to tackle the Old Testament, mix it in with the New Testament. \u00a0Do one chapter of the New and one chapter of the Old each day. \u00a0Throw in one Psalm each day if you have time. \u00a0Reading the Bible through is a journey and not a race.<\/p>\n<p>Then, maybe someday, you&#8217;ll be looking for a different approach. \u00a0When you get there, you might want to try it out loud. \u00a0Reading God&#8217;s Word as it was originally read does have it&#8217;s rewards.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Most of the Bible was written to be read aloud. \u00a0There are a few personal letters, etc., but by and large the writers never envisioned people owning personal, leather bound, red letter, annotated copies of their words. \u00a0Prior to the invention of the printing press and the Reformation, a big part of going to church [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[623,1],"tags":[40,117,202,452,451,453],"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2179"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2179"}],"version-history":[{"count":6,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2179\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":3586,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2179\/revisions\/3586"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2179"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2179"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2179"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
