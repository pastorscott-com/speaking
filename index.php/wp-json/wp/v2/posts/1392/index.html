Peter decides that if Jesus won\u2019t defend himself he\u2019ll have to do it for him. Being a fisherman and not a swordsman he swings at the wrong person (a mere servant) tries to take his head off (and misses) but does manage to cut off his ear. Somehow a full scale riot doesn\u2019t break out and Jesus reattaches poor Malchus\u2019 ear. He also reprimands Peter. Cutting off heads or even lopping off ears in Jesus\u2019 Name isn\u2019t acceptable behavior.<\/p>\n<p>Peter should have known this. He\u2019s seen that \u201cpower plays\u201d aren\u2019t Jesus\u2019 way. It\u2019s his enemies, the religious leaders, who wrap themselves up in their robes of righteousness and then say and do anything for the sake of God. As we\u2019ll see later on this same night, they aren\u2019t above lying or even manipulating murder \u201cfor the Lord.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As for Jesus, he practices what he preaches. Even as he\u2019s nailed to a cruel cross there\u2019s no \u201csword language\u201d from him. He could have called <em>\u201ctwelve legions of angels\u201d <\/em>but instead he prays for those who have it all wrong and are putting him to death.<\/p>\n<p>Later on, the infant Church takes the teachings of Jesus to heart. For them, becoming a follower of Jesus is to start down the road to martyrdom. A part of converting to Christianity is to prepare for a violent death in the Roman Coliseum. Clearly, these aren\u2019t a people of the sword.<\/p>\n<p>It would be nice if we could say that followers of Jesus have always obeyed his \u201cno swords\u201d policy but we know it\u2019s not true. At times Christians have reverted to force, not only in \u201ctaking the gospel\u201d to the world, but also in how they deal with one another. Sometimes, those who wouldn\u2019t toe some ecclesiastical line have paid dearly for their willingness to hold to their convictions. It wasn\u2019t the \u201csinners\u201d who burned them at the stake; it was the \u201cChristians.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>To this day there are those who, for the sake of Jesus, take out the sword and start swinging. Happily, in this day it\u2019s not the \u201cblood letting\u201d kind of sword. Rather they use the sword of the tongue or pen. Wrapping themselves in robes of righteousness they swing wildly at those with whom they disagree. In righteousness indignation they do all they can to draw some blood in Jesus\u2019 Name.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe things would be different if they\u2019d pay attention to the command of the Jesus they think they\u2019re defending. As he says to Peter, <em>\u201cPut your sword back in its place.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The location is the Garden of Gethsemane and Jesus is about to be arrested.
