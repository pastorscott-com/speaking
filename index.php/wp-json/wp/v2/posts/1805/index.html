Bresee is considered to be the founder of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nazarene.org\">Church of the Nazarene<\/a>.\u00a0 He was one of the people instrumental in helping the various groups who came together to form the denomination to find common ground.\u00a0 They didn&#8217;t agree at every point, but they agreed to allow people to arrive at their own understanding on a broad range of doctrinal issues while holding fast to certain core beliefs.\u00a0 To find out what those core beliefs are, check out the &#8220;Agreed Statement of Belief&#8221; section around page 37 in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nazarene.org\/files\/docs\/Manual2009-2013.pdf\">Manual of the Church of the Nazarene<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Concerning all the other stuff, Bresee urged tolerance governed by love.\u00a0 Here&#8217;s one of Brezee&#8217;s statements on this topic:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cOn the great fundamentals we are all agreed. Pertaining to things not essential to salvation, we have liberty. <strong>To attempt to emphasize that which is not essential to salvation and thus to divide forces, would be a crime. An unwillingness for others to enjoy the liberty that we enjoy in reference to doctrines not vital to salvation is bigotry, from which the spirit of holiness withdraws itself<\/strong>.\u201d (Bold by me)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I&#8217;ve heard various versions of the first part of this quote several times, but the second is new to me.\u00a0 Apparently, Bresee isn&#8217;t just all warm and fuzzy on this topic.\u00a0 Rather, he&#8217;s rather stern about it, saying those who insist on loading other stuff into the equation are practicing a sort of doctrinal &#8220;bigotry&#8221; and, because of that are operating somewhere outside the &#8220;spirit of holiness.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t help but wonder what he would think of some of the debates and finger pointing we see within our number today.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>P.F.
