That solved the slips of paper problem and worked okay. &nbsp;However, at some point it dawned on me that I was going to be typing some verses many times in my preaching career.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;So, I hit upon a plan. &nbsp;Every time I referred to a verse, I&#8217;d take time to type it onto a 3&#215;5 card. &nbsp;In my sermon notes, I simply included the reference. &nbsp;I&#8217;d organize the cards in order for that sermon, then, after the service, I&#8217;d file the cards by book of the Bible.<\/p>\n<p>From that point on a part of sermon preparation was to go through my Bible verse file and see if I&#8217;d already added the verses I wanted for the sermon. &nbsp;I&#8217;d add the news ones for that sermon and then file them after the sermon.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-Ttl02q_M2jU\/URKw5V7r-UI\/AAAAAAAASBg\/0lWSVW1YHAY\/s1600\/2013-02-06+12.10.51.jpg\" style=\"clear: left;
