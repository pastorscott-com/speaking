\u00a0Having just prayed that prayer a short time earlier, just tossing these things into the trash or down the drain is something akin to handling the Lord\u2019s Supper in an unworthy way.\u00a0 So what to do?<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately, there are godly people who have thought about this.\u00a0 After some reading I directed those in our church who prepare the sacrament to this approach; maybe it will help you too.<\/p>\n<p>If we are using the little squares of unleavened bread we return it to the container and put it back in the freezer to be used again.\u00a0 If we are using baked bread, the portion left over from the actual communion is taken outside to a little used area (like a flower garden) and left for the birds, etc. to consume. \u00a0The person taking it out offers a short prayer, thanking the Lord for his sacrifice for us.<\/p>\n<p>Grape juice that has been offered is similarly returned to the earth.\u00a0 That which was never offered in the service can be drunk as a beverage.<\/p>\n<p>While we don\u2019t accept the concept of transubstantiation we do want to be aware that these elements (that we said are symbols of our Lord\u2019s broken body and shed blood) should be handled in a respectful, reverent way.\u00a0 You might say that this is a fitting conclusion to a sacrament that emphasizes how common place things can take on uncommon meaning.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In my early ministry I remember seeing a grandmother allowing her grandkids to gather around the communion ware and drink all the left over grape juice from the tiny cups.\u00a0 I think that was the first time I ever thought about the remnants of the communion sacrament.\u00a0 At the time, I hadn\u2019t thought much about [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[623,4,1],"tags":[15,95,457,458],"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2259"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2259"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2259\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":3518,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2259\/revisions\/3518"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2259"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2259"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/speaking\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2259"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
